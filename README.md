## What the project does?
    * This project uses node package manager inquire to ask users for input regarding their store front selections.  
    * A table is provided to show all store front inventory.   
    * Essentially the user is able to select which product ID they would like and then immediately are prompted to log how many units to purchase.
    * The database is stored in mySQL so that was another package manager that was added. 
    * A fun note this project also uses console.table(); to log the data from mySQL in a table format rather than listing it out.  In order to use console.table the npm had to be installed.

## Why the project is useful?
    * This project is useful because it shows how data can be changed on the backend.    

    * It also can display updated data to reflect those changes.   

    * Finally this project provides item info for 10 products that can be purchased on Bamazon.  Each item is provided with an id, product name, dept name, price and stock quantity. Upon id request each product's quantity will update to reflect the ask.  

## How users can get started with the project?
    * In the command line users can provide the following:
    * 1. node bamazonCustomer.js 
    * 2. review table of available products
    * 3. type product id number
    * 4. type quantity requested
